# NXA (Nix Automata)

This is going to be a redo of my nixos config.

## What is Changed

my config which was initially practically a full copy of [NotAShelf's](https://github.com/NotAShelf) [nyx](https://github.com/NotAShelf/nyx) and after that I made some changes on it was a bit confusing for me cuz I'm not that good with nix's language.

I'll still be using a lot of the parts from the previous config, but I'll try to make it more manageable for myself.

# Big Thanks To

first of all, I want to say thanks to Raf ([NotAShelf's](https://github.com/NotAShelf))
His Nyx was why I got interested in Nix and making my configuration bigger and better.

And then I like to thank Mihai ([fufexan](https://github.com/fufexan)) your work with Nix always fasenated me and i would like to learn more from your repos.

## updates

since this is only an initial readme for the rewriting of my repo (which is a step up from the previous config) I'll add more to it in the future.
