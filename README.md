## nix-winder (name pending)
This is my Nixos config which is very very early in development.(i'm very new to nix and not much experienced in programming)
Currently i'm just going through other peoples nixos configs (notably [fufexan](https://github.com/fufexan), [NotAShelf](https://github.com/NotAShelf) and [Aylur](https://github.com/Aylur))
and learning about flakes and deciding what i can use, so thanks a lot for your amazing configs.

## End Goal:
My end goal is that when this configuration is done anyone who wants my my configuration can easily change the username
and get all of the config up and running in his system** and **anyone who wants a specific section of my config (window manager or bar or gpu config or fonts ...)
be able to copy one file (or copy the code) in his config file and get that part.


## too complicated?
because i love to over think stuff and that would lead to overengineering i try to do all of that
in a separate branch and keep the main branch as simple and straightforward so those who are new to nix
(my current self included) be able to mostly understand what is happening in the config and know what should thay use
to get what they want

## directoy structure
at first (as you might have figured) i tried to use [NotAShelf's](https://github.com/NotAShelf) [nyx](https://github.com/NotAShelf/nyx)
directoy structure but i soon realized that
1. i'm don't know nix enogh to understand what is happening there

2. it's goes against my end goal


so i would probebly use somthing close to that but that to that extend(at least in the main branch)
