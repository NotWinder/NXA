## nix-winder (name pending)
This is my Nixos config which is very very early in development.(i'm very new to nix and not much experienced in programming)
Currently i'm just going through other peoples nixos configs (notably [fufexan](https://github.com/fufexan), [NotAShelf](https://github.com/NotAShelf) and [Aylur](https://github.com/Aylur))
and learning about flakes and deciding what i can use, so thanks a lot for your amazing configs.

## directoy structure
as you might have figured i want to use [NotAShelf's](https://github.com/NotAShelf) [nyx](https://github.com/NotAShelf/nyx)
so if it might be better to check out their repo rater then mine.
